  This project is used to hold code used in common by a number of the
  sipX family servers. It is not intended to be useful as a standalone
  project.

  fastdb
      A shared-memory database used to hold frequently accessed data
      in a number of relational tables. Our implementation is derived
      from FastDB by Konstantin Knizhnik.

  sipdb
      Application specific wrapper classes for the tables we store in
      fastdb. These classes also implement an XML persistence
      mechanism for these tables.

  digitmaps
      Parsing and processing of an XML mapping rules format used to
      parse and transform SIP URLs, IPv4 address, and FQDN addresses.
