  <title>&sipxecs; Installation, Setup, and Configuration Requirements</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>
      Everything in this note is intended to serve as the basis for a
      discussion of how to expand and reorganize the installation and
      configuration of &sipxecs; services to meet the distributed system
      goals of release &sipxrelease; and beyond.
    </para>

    <title>Scenarios</title>

    <para>
      This section is organized as a series of user workflow narratives:
      steps that a user (usually a &sipxecs; administrator) takes to
      accomplish some end.  
    </para>  

    <section id='inst'>
      <title>Installation</title>

      <section id='inst.single.iso'>
        <title>Installation of a single system using ISO image</title>

        <para>
          Our administrator chooses a system that meets the hardware
          requirements to be the new &sipxecs; server, inserts the &sipxecs;
          installation CD (or perhaps soon, a DVD) in the drive, and boots
          from it.  After a prompt to ensure that it is acceptable to
          re-initialize the system and destroy all data on the drives, the
          installation run automatically, ejects the installation disk, and
          reboots.
        </para>

        <para>
          Following the reboot, the user is prompted to log in as 'root'
          using the default 'setup' password, and a single-use script
          invokes the &sipxsetup; wizard.  See <xref linkend='setup'/> for details
          of the &sipxsetup; application and what it configures.
          <emphasis>
            The single-use script must de-activate itself so that it will not
            be run on subsequent root logins before it invokes the
            &sipxsetup; application, since that application may reboot the
            system.
          </emphasis>
        </para>

        <para>
          After the &sipxsetup; application has established the minimal
          conditions for operation of &sipxsuper; and &sipxconfig;, it  the &sipxsuper;
          service has started

      <section id='inst.single.rpm'>
        <title>Installation of a system using RPMs</title>

        <para>
          Installation from RPMs can be done either by installing
          individual rpms manually, or by configuring the package
          manager (yum, apt, or whatever) to include a repository
          containing them and directing the package manager to install the
          required components.
        </para>

        <para>
          The &sipxecspgk; that installs all the &sipxecs;
          components.  The recommended installation method is to install
          this umbrella rpm so that all components are installed.
          <emphasis>Installing a component does not configure any service
          to automatically start.</emphasis> 
        </para>

        <para>
          Following installation, the administrator must run the &sipxsetup;
          wizard program manually, which configures the minimum system
          parameters as it does when run in the iso installation.  If all
          of the minimal parameters are configured, the &sipxsetup; program
          will configure the &sipxsuper; process to start automatically on
          the next reboot (and may also start it directly); see <xref
          linkend='supervisor'/>.

        <title>Initial Configuration with &sipxconfig;</title>
        <para>
          The first time that the administrator logs in to the &sipxconfig;
          web user interface, a number of configuration choices must be
          made that establish the basic system parameters and configure
          each of the required services.  Until the required services have
          been configured and activated, ordinary use of the &sipxconfig;
          administrative and user interfaces is not allowed; only a
          checklist of the remaining required choices is possible.

      <section id='inst.cluster'>
        <title>Installation of a system cluster</title>
        <para>
          The installation of a &sipxecs; cluster begins with the
          installation of the master system: from an iso image (<xref
          linkend='inst.single.iso'/>) or rpms (<xref
          linkend='inst.single.rpm'/>).  Once the <link

          <title>Adding a distributed system</title>
          <para>
            The configuration operation in &sipxconfig; for adding a new

                  The set of services to be run on the new system.  Some
                  services (such as &sipxsuper; and ntpd) are required on every
                  system in a cluster.

          </para>

          <para>
            The &sipxconfig; generates the initial configuration for the new

            When all required information has been provided and this
            configuration is ready, &sipxconfig; displays a system setup

            Once the &sipxconfig; has <link linkend='dist.add'>prepared a

            or <link linkend='inst.single.rpm'>on an existing system from

            application (if using the iso installer, this happens on the
            first login as root).  The &sipxsetup; application fetches the
            prepared configuration from the master system as described in

          <para>
            To add a service to an existing installation, the administrator
            uses &sipxconfig; to first select the system in the cluster
            where the service should be added, and configures the service
            to run on that system.  &sipxconfig; then collects any
            configuration information needed to initialize that service,

        The &sipxsetup; is an application that gets the information
        essential to initializing the system and bringing up the &sipxsuper;
        process manager; it does this by performing a series of
        steps (described below).  

        <emphasis>
          The &sipxsetup; can be stopped after any step.  When restarted,
          it must resume at the first uncompleted step, with all values
          from earlier steps already saved and working on the system.

              It then configures the network using the supplied parameters and
              attempts to start it.  If the network startup succeeds and appears
              to be correct (determined by attempting to 'ping' the default
              gateway), the &sipxsetup; proceeds.  If the network does not
              appear to be correct, the administrator is offered the choice of
              reconfiguring the network or shutting down the system at this point
              so that it can be moved to be connected to the network.

            The resources section specifies each of the resources used by
            the process, and for each whether or not the resource must
            exist before the process can be started.  The resources can be:

                  The name of another &sipxecs; service that must be
                  running before this service is started.

            The &sipxsuper; provides a set of XML RPC operations that allow
            &sipxconfig; to read, create, or modify the resources required
            by any defined service.

                <emphasis>
                  The &sipxsuper; must not provide any operation that will
                  create or modify anything on the system that is not
                  declared as a resource by some service definition, and must
                  not modify any part of any service definition.  This is
                  the basis of the system integrity protection.

          The &sipxsuper; maintains local state that controls what

          A set of XML RPC operations is provided by &sipxsuper; to allow
          the &sipxconfig; on the master system to enable and disable
          services; these operations change the local state so that the
          &sipxsuper; will always attempt to start the same set of services
          that were enabled when &sipxconfig; last set them.

        <para>
          Before attempting to start any service, &sipxsuper;:

                If one is defined, it executes the configuration test
                command defined by the service.  It reads any standard
                error output and saves it.  The exit status of the test
                command is checked:
