System Description
-----------------

The tester consists of a number of test clients
Each test client is a process that can house user agent.

Each user agent:

- Sets up a SIP/RTP session with the conference bridge.
- Streams a media that is encoded 8 bit ULAW encoding at the conferece bridge
- Listen for incoming media stream.
- Computes the "power level" of the incoming media stream every 100 samples.

At the end of streaming the file the average standard deviation of the power signal
(i.e. the average of the standard deviation computed by each client)
is computed and recorded as a function of the number of clients. 

If the mixing is perfect, the standard deviation of the mixed stream power 
level should be 0. Higher the standard deviation indicates poorer mixing.

To build the tester
-------------------

Edit configure.properties and fix the location for the commons directory.
ant compile compiles things. 


To configure and start the tester
---------------------------------

- Start the conference bridge. The conference bridge particulars are made 
known to the tester in a file called testerconfig.xml which is read by the
tester at startup and it looks as follows:

<sipx-proxy-domain>example.com</sipx-proxy-domain>
<sipx-proxy-address>sipxpbx.example.com</sipx-proxy-address>
<sipx-proxy-port>5060</sipx-proxy-port>
<conference-extension>301</conference-extension>
<test-duration>45</test-duration>


Here you should have set up the conference to run at extension 301. 
The tester does not do authentication hence set the password not be set.

- You can run multiple tester clients from different processes. 
  Each tester client has a defintion in a file called testerconfig.xml
  Each tester client process is invoked as follows:

  ant tester -DclientId=1

Where client1 has a defintion in testerconfig.xml as follows:

<tester-client>
	<client-id>client1</client-id>
	<xml-rpc-port>8087</xml-rpc-port>
	<tester-host>192.168.5.240</tester-host>
	<media-file>testmedia/250hz.au</media-file>
	<tester-sip-base-port>5230</tester-sip-base-port>
	<tester-rtp-base-port>30000</tester-rtp-base-port>
	<media-file> ... </media-file>
</tester-client>


media-file is a file which will be streamed
after the call is set up. If you specify nothing here, the
media is chosen round Round Robin fashion from one of the monotone
frequencies in testmedia. For mixing experiments, leave the media-file
tag out.

When all the tester clients are started, the controller ( which is the
first tester client ) signals each one to go using an xml RPC command to
do this. At that time, the tester client will establish a SIP/SDP/RTP
session with the conference bridge and stream media to it ( or listen
passively ).

Various manual experiments are possible:
 - Test mixing in the presence of white noise by joining the conference 
   when white noise is streaming.

When the test is done, the result will be appended to the
file called result.txt and the testers will exit.


Preliminary results
------------------

I simulated all the test clients on a single machine which was the same
machine as the machine on which the bridge and the rest of sipx runs.
Based on my preliminary observations, mixing starts to break down at
about 5 simultaneous streams.  I was not able to connect more than 6
participants simultaneously.

The results should be repeated using at least two machines to do the test 
to include network delay and jitter into the test results.

For an example of what can be generated, please run the "plotit.sh" script
which will plot my results using gnuplot.

Future work
-----------

Included is a pcap capture facility that can play back media streams
from wirshark captures of the media. If deemed useful, we can 
at a future date, simulate live conferences in the presence of 
noise to see how intelligible the speech is to a human observer.


Acknowledgement

 Woof! suggested the metric to use to evaluate goodness of 
 mixing which has been used here with some modifications.
 The tester recycles some code developed by Woof! for the paging server.
