<p>
This test server is provided by
<a href='http://www.nortel.com'>Nortel Networks</a> (which has acquired <a
href='http://www.pingtel.com/'>Pingtel</a>), in cooperation with the
<a href='http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipX'>SIPfoundry sipXecs project</a>, for open interoperability
testing of SIP user agents.
This server runs a development version of the
<a href='http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipX'>sipXecs open source software</a>
with a <a href='#config'>custom configuration</a>.  This configuration
is designed to exercise issues we have found are important to
interoperability between User Agents and Proxies.
This server is restarted once a week, at 00:00 Sunday UTC.
The restart process takes approximately 2 minutes.
</p>
<p>
A similarly configured interoperability test server is available for
the <a href='http://products.nortel.com/go/product_content.jsp?segId=0&amp;parId=0&amp;prod_id=63420'>
Nortel SCS 500</a>, which is derived in part from the sipXecs open
source project.  That server runs a stable released version, and is
available at <a href='http://interop.scs500demo.com'>interop.scs500demo.com</a>.

<h2>Addresses</h2>

<p>
The tests below are organized so that they can be used by more than
one tester at a time - if you pick your own group of extensions.  Pick
a number between 10 and 99 - this is your <span class='group'>group
number</span>; in the addresses below, the group number
is shown as "<span class='group'>gg</span>".  To see if the group
number you have chosen is in use, check the
<a href="registrations.cgi">registrations page</a> - look for any
User values that use that group number.   Each group consists of 9
addresses that you can register:
</p>
<pre>
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>1@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>2@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>3@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>4@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>5@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>6@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>7@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>8@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
    sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>9@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@
</pre>

<!-- REMOVED TEMPORARILY until we are sure that TCP is working right.

<h2>DNS SRV</h2>

<p>
The SRV records for <code>@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code> are set to prefer
TCP; your user agent should choose TCP over UDP.
</p>

-->

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
The credentials for the test addresses are:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Address Of Record</dt>
  <dd><code>sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>n@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code>
    <br />(for n= 1..9)
  </dd>
  <dt>User Name</dt>
  <dd><code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>n</code>
    <br />(The user part of the address)
  </dd>
  <dt>Realm</dt>
  <dd><code>@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code></dd>
  <dt>Password</dt>
  <dd><code>1234</code></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The database of current registration information can be seen on the
<a href="registrations.cgi">registrations page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Confirm that your UA is refreshing its registration correctly - note
that the registrar randomizes the expiration time of each register
request, so it will normally be less than the requested time.
If the UA does not pay attention to the registration time granted,
the UA's registration will repeatedly appear and disappear.
</p>

<p>
The <a name="nonces">authentication nonces</a> provided by sipX are
specific to the
from-tag in the request.  Section 8.1.3.5 of RFC 3261 requires that a
re-sent request has the same from-tag as the original request, so the
nonce that sipX returns in a 401/407 response can always be used in a
re-send of the request.  However, some UAs will incorrectly use a
different from-tag when resending a REGISTER.  These UAs will not be
able to register.
</p>

<!--
<p>
If the UA provides a <code>+sip.instance</code> parameter and the
extension it is registering for is not
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>7</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>8</code>,
or <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>9</code>, the registrar will
assign a GRUU to the UA.
(The GRUU suppression feature is not yet implemented.)
</p>
-->

<p>
The registrar returns to the UA a fictitious contact from another UA
with a <a name="expiration">very short expiration time</a>.
(This behavior is allowed by
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">RFC 3261</a>.)
Some UAs respond incorrectly to the short expiration time by
immediately re-registering.
A <font color='red'>red</font> value in the "CSeq" column of the
<a href="registrations.cgi">registrations page</a> means that
the UA has incorrectly sent more than 2
registrations in the last 5 minutes, which  indicates it probably has
this error.
</p>

<h2>Confirming Basic Functionality</h2>

<p>
A call to "<code>sip:100@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code>" will be answered by an
auto-attendant.
Any SIP UA can call a registered UA by calling its AOR,
"<code>sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>n@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code>".
</p>

<h2>Tracing</h2>

<p>
There is an experimental interface you can use
to <a href='trace.cgi'>trace the message flow in this system</a>.

<h3><a name='MWI'>1</a>. DTMF Generation and Message Waiting Indication (MWI)</h3>

<p>
The addresses 1<span class='group'>gg</span>1 and 1<span
class='group'>gg</span>2 each have a voicemail box; they may SUBSCRIBE
for the <code>message-summary</code> event package.  You can call the
voicemail box directly by calling user
<code>2<span class='group'>gg</span>1</code> or <code>2<span class='group'>gg</span>2</code>.
to deposit voicemail.
</p>

<p>
Voicemail can be retrieved by calling 101 from UAs registered as
1<span class='group'>gg</span>1 and 1<span class='group'>gg</span>2.
The voicemail PIN is the same as the SIP registration password for the AOR.
The voicemail server interprets
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2833.txt">RFC 2833</a> DTMF packets.
</p>

<h3><a name='407'>2</a>. Authenticated INVITE (407 Proxy Authentication Required)</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>3<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be challenged for authentication, and when successfully
authenticated will ring <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>.
</p>

<h3><a name='403'>3</a>. Authenticated INVITE (403 Forbidden)</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>4<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be challenged for authentication, but even when authenticated
only a caller with an extension ending in 7, 8, or 9 is allowed to
complete the call
(which will ring <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>).  Any
other caller will get a 403 Forbidden response.  This allows you to
test whether or not your user interface communicates the reason for
the call failure.
</p>

<h3><a name='xfer'>4</a>. Transfer</h3>

<p>
Most transfer operations are between endpoints in SIP, but you can
use this system to make sure that you are doing those operations in a
way that operates correctly through a proxy.
</p>
<p>
There are some specific things to check:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
Check whether or not your UA accepts a blind transfer
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
Whether or not your UA cannot act as the controller for a blind transfer, you
can test whether or not it correctly handles being the transferee;
a call to "<code>sip:100@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code>" will be answered by an
auto-attendant - when you enter a registered extension at the prompt
(your UA must use RFC 2833 to send DTMF in the RTP),
the auto-attendant will blind-transfer your call (REFER without Replaces).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Authenticated blind transfer
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If your UA initiates a blind transfer (sends REFER without Replaces) to any registered
UA, the REFER request will be challenged by the proxy with a 407
response.  The transfer controller UA must retry the request with
authentication added.
</p>
<p>
The authenticated request will be forwarded by the proxy to the
transferee, with a header parameter added to the Refer-To (transfer
target) URL.  The transferee UA must correctly include the specified
header (X-Sipx-Authidentity) in the INVITE it sends to the transfer
target.  You can test whether or not your UA constructs this header
correctly by transfering it
to <code>3<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>.  This path is
challenged unless authenticated by the above header; if the header is
correct, the call will be routed
to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>
(see <a href='#407'>Authenticated INVITE test</a> above).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Check consultative transfer
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
If your user agent(s) can do consultative transfer (REFER with
Replaces), then you should also try that through the proxy using
another UA.  The REFER for a consultative transfer is not challenged
for authentication.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
Check "semi-consultative" transfer
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
It is common for the person attempting a consultative transfer to exit
from the process with the expectation that the party being transferred
will talk to the party that ultimately answers the new call -- in
effect, to convert a consultative transfer into a blind transfer.
Some user agents do not provide a separate blind transfer operation,
so the user must use a semi-consultative transfer.
With other user agents, users often never discover how to activate the
blind transfer operation, and so do semi-consultative transfers instead.
</p>
<p>
Doing semi-consultative transfers reliably has been studied
carefully:  see section 7.6 of 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer-11.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-cc-transfer-11.txt</a>.
The reliable way for a user agent to carry out this operation is
to continue with the consultative transfer sequence until the called
party answers, and then send the REFER with Replaces that completes
the consultative transfer.
This has been known for years, and yet many user agents use unreliable
(and sometimes bizarre) methods to handle semi-consultative transfers.
</p>
<p>
You can verify that your user agents generate the same message flow
for semi-consultative transfers that they do for consultative
transfers by using the <a href='trace.cgi'>trace feature</a>,
searching for the substring "1<span class='group'>gg</span>".
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name='sfork'>5</a>. Serial Forking</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code>
will be forked to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code> in some random order.  If not
answered, the first extension called will receive a CANCEL when the
next is called.  Make sure that your caller connects with the UA
that answers, and that all the others correctly clean up the
canceled requests.
Note that ringing four contacts can take quite a while, and the
calling UA or the sipX proxy may time out the call attempt before
all four UAs ring.
</p>

<h3><a name='pfork'>6</a>. Parallel Forking</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>6<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code>
will be simultaneously forked to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code>.  When one answers, the others will
receive a CANCEL.  Make sure that your caller connects with the UA
that answers, and that all the others correctly clean up the
canceled requests.
</p>

<h3><a name='long'>7</a>. Long Paths / Large Messages</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>7<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will spiral several times within the proxy so that when received at <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>x</code> it will have several Vias.  This
checks your handling of large messages (if UDP, they will be fragmented).
</p>

<h3><a name='merged'>8</a>. Merged INVITE</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>8<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be forked such that two INVITE requests will be received at <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>x</code> with the same Call-Id, Cseq, and From tag
values, but different branch ids.  The UAC should accept the first one
and return a 482 Loop Detected response to the second.  Make sure that
the loop detected error is sent and that the call is correctly set up
when the called UA answers.
</p>

<h3><a name='hoplimit'>9</a>. Hop Limit Exceeded</h3>

<p>
Any call to <code>9000</code> will return a 483 Too Many Hops.  As a
diagnostic aid, this software returns part of the failed request in
the body of the 483 response.  This allows you to test whether or not
your user interface conveys the reason for the failure (and is not
troubled by the response body).  For information on the motivation for
this response construction, see
<a href='http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/lawrence/hopcopy/draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics-03.html'>Diagnostic Responses for Session Initiation Protocol Hop Limit Errors</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name='pickup'>10</a>. Call Pick-Up</h3>

<p>
Any call to <code>*78xxxx</code> will pick up the call ringing on the
UA at <code>xxxx</code>.  To use this feature:
</p>

<ol>
<li>From one UA, call a second UA via <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>Leave the call ringing.</li>
<li>From a third UA, call <code>*781<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>The third UA should now be talking to the first UA, and the second
should no longer be ringing.</li>
<li>If the second UA answers the call before the third UA calls <code>*781<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>, the third UA should receive a
<code>404</code> response rather than connecting to the first UA.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This test should work whether or not the first or third UAs are
registered to the test server.
</p>

<p>
This test checks that the first UA correctly handles INVITE with Replaces and
the early-only option, and whether the second UA generates
dialog event notices with usable endpoint identification.
</p>

<h3><a name='pickup-forked'>11</a>. Call Pick-Up of a Forked Call</h3>

<p>
Register UAs, the <em>target UAs</em>,
 for AORs <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code>.
</p>

<p>
From another UA, the <em>calling UA</em>,
call <code>6<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code>, which
will be simultaneously forked to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code>.
</p>

<p>
The call should ring on <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code>.
</p>

<p>
From yet another UA, the <em>executing UA</em>,
call <code>*781<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>.
It should pick up the first call, ending the ringing on the target UAs
and establishing a call between the executing UA and the calling UA.
</p>

<p>
Hang up and repeat the sequence, changing the second call to
<code>*781<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>,
<code>*781<span class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and
<code>*781<span class='group'>gg</span>6</code> on successive trials.
Each should pick up the forked call.
</p>

<p>
This test checks that the calling UA correctly tracks the four early
dialogs generated by the forked call.
</p>

<h3><a name='park'>12</a>. Call Park and Retrieve</h3>

<p>
The extensions <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x
1-9) are <em>parking orbits</em>.
(The extensions <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code> are used
in the Serial Forking test described above.)
If a call is transferred to a parking orbit, it will connect to the
<em>park server</em> user agent, which plays music.
A call can be retrieved from a parking orbit by calling
<code>*4xxxx</code>, where <code>xxxx</code> is the parking orbit.
If there are several calls parked on the same orbit, the one that was
parked there first is retrieved.
</p>

<p>
This test checks that the parked UA handles in-dialog REFERs and the
retrieving UA handles INVITE with Replaces.
</p>

<p>
You can subscribe to the call park extensions to get their dialog events.
</p>

<h3><a name='dialog'>13</a>. Dialog Event Package</h3>

<p>
Once a registered UA has generated a dialog event package, this server
can retrieve a copy from its logs and display an analysis of the
dialog event package against some of the criteria in the
Internet-Draft
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/wg/sip/draft-worley-sip-dialog-03.txt"><code>draft-worley-sip-dialog-03</code></a>,
"Guidelines for Implementing the Dialog Event Package in User Agents".
</p>

<p>
To use this feature, execute a call pick-up where the second UA in the
procedure (the called UA) is the UA whose dialog event package you
would like to examine.
Then enter its extension number in the box below and click on the
link.
Violations of the guidelines are marked in
<font color='red'>red</font> in the analysis.
</p>

<form action='dialog-event.cgi' method='GET'>
Extension: <input name='extension' size='4' maxlength='4' />
<input type='submit' value='Analyze dialog event' />
</form>

<p>
You can subscribe to the call park extensions to get their dialog events.

<h3><a name='moh'>15</a>. Music on Hold</h3>

<p>
User agents that provide "music on hold" via the technique of
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-service-example-02.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-worley-service-example-02.txt</a>
can use the URI <code>sip:~~mh~@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code> as an
audio source.  (This source should work with other MoH techniques as well.)
</p>

<h3><a name='double-hold'>16</a>. Double-Hold Scenarios</h3>

<p>
The purpose of these tests is to verify that two UAs can handle when
both UAs put the opposite ends of one call on hold.  It is most
informative when both UAs are configured to generate
<a href='#moh'>music-on-hold</a>.
</p>

<p>
First test:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Call from the first UA to the second UA.</li>
<li>At the first UA, put the call on hold.</li>
<li>The second UA should receive music-on-hold.</li>
<li>At the second UA, put the call on hold.</li>
<li>At the second UA, take the call off hold.</li>
<li>The second UA should receive music-on-hold.</li>
<li>At the first UA, take the call off hold.</li>
<li>The UAs should pass audio in both directions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Second test:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Call from the first UA to the second UA.</li>
<li>At the first UA, put the call on hold.</li>
<li>The second UA should receive music-on-hold.</li>
<li>At the second UA, put the call on hold.</li>
<li>At the first UA, take the call off hold.</li>
<li>The first UA should receive music-on-hold.</li>
<li>At the second UA, take the call off hold.</li>

<h3><a name='ENUM'>18</a>. ENUM Dialing</h3>

<p>
This server supports ENUM dialing using the "official" public enum
tree <code>e164.arpa</code>.
To contact an ENUM destination from this server, the user-part of the URI
should be <code>*2</code> followed by the ENUM dial string.
For example:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>*2 1 800 555 1234</code></dt>
  <dd>Routes to the ENUM for the E.164 number +1 800 555 1234.</dd>
  <dt><code>*2 43 720 0101011</code></dt>
  <dd>Routes to the ENUM test number +43 720 0101011.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Additional ENUM test numbers can be found at
<a href="http://www.enum-test.at/index_en.html"><code>http://www.enum-test.at/index_en.html</code></a>.
</p>

<h3><a name='JOIN'>19</a>. Ad-hoc Conferencing</h3>

<p>
Ad-hoc conferencing is useful in call-control applications.
It is implemented using an INVITE with the Join header.
</p>

<p>
Any call to <code>*79xxxx</code> will be turned into an
INVITE-with-Join to the call that is active on the
UA at <code>xxxx</code>, which sets up an ad-hoc conference of the new
caller with the existing participants of the call on <code>xxxx</code>.
To use this feature:
</p>

<ol>
<li>From one UA, call a second UA via <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>Answer the call.</li>
<li>From a third UA, call <code>*791<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>The the three UAs should all be conferenced together.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This test should work whether or not the first or third UAs are
registered to the test server.
</p>

<p>
This test checks that the first UA correctly handles INVITE with Join,
and whether the second UA generates
dialog event notices with usable endpoint identification.
</p>

<h3><a name='SRV'>20</a>. DNS SRV Record Processing</h3>

<p>
This server also supports the SIP domains
<code>@INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP@</code> and <code>@INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP@</code>.
These domain names do not have DNS A records, rather they are
configured with DNS SRV records for the UDP and TCP protocols,
respectively.  A UA should support DNS SRV records and both the UDP
and TCP protocols, so it should be able to use either of these domain
names in place of <code>@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@</code> to place calls
in all of the tests.
</p>

<h3><a name='BLF'>21</a>. BLF (Busy Lamp Field) and Dialog-Event Resource Lists</h3>

<p>
Some UAs can subscribe to a resource list of dialog events to obtain
and display BLF information.  BLF (Busy Lamp Field) is a feature of
a UA where it displays the busy/not-busy statuses of other AORs
(extensions).
This server provides a resource list URI
"sip:~~rl~F~<span class='group'>gg</span>@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@"
which includes the statuses of
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>2@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@",
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>6@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@", and
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>9@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@".
The dialog events generated for thse resource list URIs are in full
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4662.txt">RFC 4662</a> format,
including listing the status of each registered UA for each AOR
separately.
If your UA requires dialog events in the more restricted format
provided by Broadworks, it should subscribe to the URI
"sip:~~rl~C~<span class='group'>gg</span>@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@".
</p>

<p>
As a consequence of maintaining the resource lists, the server
maintains a dialog event subscription to all UAs registered to the
URIs
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>2@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@",
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>6@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@", and
"sip:1<span class='group'>gg</span>9@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@".
Beware that some UAs <a href='#two-dialog-subs'>cannot serve more than
one dialog event
subscription</a>.  Such UAs should not register for these AORs, and will
not work consistently with any sipX feature that requires dialog events,
including call pick-up.
</p>

<h3><a name='two-dialog-subs'>22</a>. Multiple Dialog Event Subscriptions</h3>

<p>
SIP requires that a UA can support multiple subscriptions to its
dialog event status.  A UA can be tested to ensure that it supports
multiple dialog event subscriptions:
</p>

<p>
Register the UA as
1<span class='group'>gg</span>2,
1<span class='group'>gg</span>6, or
1<span class='group'>gg</span>9.
Configure a second UA to display BLF information from
"sip:~~rl~<span class='group'>gg</span>@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@".
</p>

<p>
From a third UA, call the first UA.  The first UA should ring, and the
second UA's BLF should indicate that the first UA is ringing.
</p>

<p>
From a fourth UA, pick up this call by calling
<code>*781<span class='group'>gg</span>n</code>, as appropriate.
The fourth UA will be talking to the third UA.
Hang up this call.
The second UA's BLF should indicate that the first UA is idle.
</p>

<p>
From the third UA, call the first UA again.
Answer the call at the first UA.
The second UA's BLF should indicate that the first UA is busy.
</p>

<h3><a name='BLF-status'>23</a>. BLF Status Display</h3>

<p>
This test shows whether a UA sends comprehensive status information,
and whether a second UA's BLF correctly and comprehensively displays
status information.
</p>

<p>
Register a first UA as 1<span class='group'>gg</span>2
and a second UA as 1<span class='group'>gg</span>6.
Configure a third UA to display BLF information from
"sip:~~rl~<span class='group'>gg</span>@@SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME@".
</p>

<p>
Initially, the third UA should show the first and second UAs as idle.
</p>

<p>
Take the first UA off-hook and start (but not finish) dialing
1<span class='group'>gg</span>6.
The third UA should show the first UA as in-use (state "trying")
and the second UA as idle.
</p>

<p>
Finish dialing on the first UA.  The second UA should ring.
The third UA should show the first UA as in-use (state "early",
direction "initiator") and the second UA as
ringing (state "early", direction "recipient").
</p>

<p>
Answer the call on the second UA.
The third UA should show the first and second UAs as in-use (state
"confirmed").
</p>

<p>
At the first UA, put the call on hold.
The third UA should show the first UA as on-hold (state "confirmed"
with local feature
parameter <code>+sip.rendering=no</code>), and the second UA as
in-use.
</p>

<p>
At the first UA, take the call off hold.
The third UA should show the first and second UAs as in-use (state
"confirmed").
</p>

<p>
At the first UA, hang up the call.
The third UA should show the first and second UAs as idle.
</p>

<h3><a name='loopdetected'>24</a>. Proxy Loop Detection</h3>

<p>
Any call to <code>9001</code> will return a 482 Loop Detected error.  As a
diagnostic aid, this software returns part of the failed request in
the body of the 482 response.  This allows you to test whether or not
your user interface conveys the reason for the failure (and is not
troubled by the response body).  For information on the motivation for
this response construction, see
<a href='http://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/lawrence/hopcopy/draft-ietf-sip-hop-limit-diagnostics-03.html'>Diagnostic Responses for Session Initiation Protocol Hop Limit Errors</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name='Require'>25</a>. Processing the <code>Require</code> Header</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt">RFC 3261</a> requires
that if a UA receives a request containing a <code>Require</code> header that names
a SIP extension that it does not implement, it must reject the request
with a 420 Extension Not Implemented response.
Any call to <code>*63xxxx</code> is sent to the UA at
<code>xxxx</code> after having the header <code>Require: merde</code>
added to the INVITE.
Since there is not and never will be a SIP extension named
<code>merde</code>, the destination UA must reject this INVITE with a
420 response.
