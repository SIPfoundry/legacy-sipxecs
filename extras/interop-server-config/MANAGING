Notes on managing a sipX "interop server".

* DNS configuration

The SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME name should have an ordinary DNS A record.

To support the "DNS SRV Record Processing" test, the INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP
and INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP names should have DNS SRV records like these:

_sip._tcp.{INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP}. IN SRV   1 1 5060 {SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME}.
_sip._udp.{INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP}. IN SRV   1 1 5060 {SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME}.

INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP and INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP are defined in config.defs.in.
Their default value is the `hostname -f` prefixed with "udp." and "tcp.".

* To load or update the sipX code from a set of RPMs:

First, load the desired RPMs into a directory on the interop server.

    To load from a development build at Bluesocket, you need a two-step
    process to get the RPMs onto interop.pingtel.com, because interop is
    outside the firewall.

    From a machine inside Bluesocket, create a directory and download the
    RPMs for the desired version.  E.g.:

            wget --no-parent -r -nd \
                    http://falcon.us.nortel.com/ecs/main/FC/8/i386/010020/RPM

    Create a destination directory on interop (e.g., ~/010020) and upload
    the RPMs to it:

            scp *.rpm interop:010020

On the interop server, stop sipX and install the new PRMs:

        sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx stop

        sudo rpm --upgrade -p ~/010020/*.rpm

Note that rpm will attempt to install any RPMs that have the *same*
version as the currently installed version, as well as any that are
*newer*.  The former will fail (which causes the entire rpm command to
fail), so you have to inspect the output of rpm for messages like
this:

        package xerces-c-2.7.0-3 is already installed
        package rubygems-0.8.11-2 is already installed
        package cgicc-3.2.3-2 is already installed

Rename these RPMs to have a different extension (or delete them), and
run the rpm command again.

Regarding RPMs whose names do not start with "sip", once they have
been installed, they rarely need to be updated.

Do not install:

    1) the sipXconfig RPMs (sipxconfig, sipxconfig-agent, sipxconfig-ftp,
    sipxconfig-report, and sipxconfig-tftp), as the interop configuration
    uses special config files,

    2) the Call Resolver (sipxproxy-cdr), as that requires Postgres to be
    set up,

    3) the sipxecs RPMs, as they are just umbrella packages that "require"
    all the other RPMs, and

    4) the java-NNN-sun-NNN.rpm, java-NNN-sun-fonts-NNN.rpm, and
    sipx*-devel-* RPMs can also be omitted.

    5) the sipx-freeswitch-* RPMs rarely change, so they rarely need to be
    updated.

Install the setsipxpasswd program.  You may have to load it from the
sipX source using

        wget http://sipxecs.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipXecs/main/sipXcommserverLib/meta/setsipxpasswd

Install the XML::Simple and File::ReadBackwards modules from CPAN:

        yum install perl-CPAN
        cpan XML::Simple File::ReadBackwards
             [You can safely decline to manually configure CPAN.]

Once the software is installed, reload the interop configuration
(which may have been modified by the sipX install), and restart sipX:

        touch interop-server-config/sipx_confdir/config.defs.in
        sudo make -C interop-server-config install
        sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx start

To avoid having rpm complain about unknown digital signatures on the
RPMs, install the sipX signing key:

        wget --no-check-certificate https://secure2.pingtel.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-pingtel
        sudo rpm --import RPM-GPG-KEY-pingtel

Note that installing the sipX RPMs will set init to run sipX in
runlevels 3 and 5 (normal operation states).

* To load or update the Interop sipX configuration:

Install the perl-XML-Parser RPM to provide XML/Parser.pm.

Obtain a copy of the configuration files with either:

        wget -np -nH -r http://sipxecs.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipXecs/main/extras/interop-server-config
        cd rep/sipXecs/main/extras/interop-server-config

or to get a Subversion working copy:

        svn co -q https://sipxecs.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipXecs/main/extras/interop-server-config
        cd interop-server-config

Edit the SETSIPXPASSWD line of ./Makefile to specify the location of
the setsipxpasswd program.  (See above for installation instructions.)

Edit the SIPX_USER line of ./Makefile to specify the correct user
name, the one that is in /etc/passwd -- open-source versions usually
use the name 'sipx' and commercial versions usually use the name
'sipxchange'. Edit the SIPX_GROUP line of ../Makefile to specify the
correct group name, usually the default group of the user SIPX_USER.
In systems meant for production or semi-production use, SIPX_GROUP is
usually the same as SIPX_USER.

Generate the config.defs file:

        cd .../interop-server-config
        touch sipx_confdir/config.defs.in
        sudo make /etc/sipxpbx/config.defs

Edit /etc/sipxpbx/config.defs for any needed customization.

Note that config.defs by default sets the SIP domain name of the
server to `hostname -f`, and from that generates the UDP-only and
TCP-only names.  The following steps edit those names into the
user-visible files.

Generate the remainder of the configuration files:

        sudo make install

Restart sipX:

        sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx restart

* monitoring scripts

The directory "scripts" contains some scripts that are informative to
run every day.

Note that "registration-summary" executes "regtimes" (from sipXtools),
which requires the Perl module DateTime::Format::ISO8601.  You can
install that by executing:

        sudo cpan install DateTime::Format::ISO8601

On Fedora Core 6, it also requires the perl RPM to be version
perl-5.8.8-10.el5_0.2 or later.
