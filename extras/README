The 'extras' directory is for sipX-related resources that are useful
enough to be kept under source control, but not tightly enough
integrated into the deliverable packages that there is a proper place
for them in the sipX* directories.  A "junk drawer" for sipX, if you
will.

Please add a brief description of items you enter in this directory:

interop-server-config
	Files for configuring sipX to be an interoperability testing
	server.

freeswitch-tester
	A tester for load testing the freeswitch conference bridge.
