What is this?
=============
This is a regression test tool for sipx.


How this works:
===============

This tool aims to emulate the signaling from a previously recorded
successful test run.  A developer may run a test case using actual phones
etc. and re-run the test later using emulated drivers that mimic the
operation of the phones and gateways of interest. It works by record
and replay.  It uses a merged.xml from capture of an existing working
system to generate the signaling playback.

The following are inputs :

- a file containing ${testdir}/sut-config.xml that defines the endpoints to be emulated. These endpoints
must be identified as Proxy or user-agent.
- a file  and the merged.xml file generated from running a successful test (using actual phones
and gatways). This file is filtered using sipx-trace.  
- a mapping file ${testdir}/test-maps.xml that maps the trace addresses and users to users
and addresses on the system under test.

It uses these inputs to figure out the client and server transactions
in that file and generates the same stimulus through emulated endpoints
that mimic the signaling. The idea is that by mimicing the signaling at
a later time, we can tell if a regression failure occured. This would
happen if something changed in the call setup signaling.  The regression
tester is set up to catch such failures.

Example
=======

For example, if you wanted to construct a test
where two phones register with the sipx registrar and call each other,
you would proceed as follows.


1. Run the test on a system where you would like to gather trace. Lets say you have user1 calling user2 on the trace system.
2. Filter the trace using sipx-trace.  You would need to capture both the phone REGISTER and INVITE tranasactions.
3. Define the endpoints of interest using the file ${testcase}/sut-config.xml.   In this case the endpoints will be the phones
from where the call setup signaling originated.
4. Configure the system under test with emulated users.  These are user accounts on the system under test that 
will be used for the sole purpose of testing. Lets say you have defined testuser1 and testuser2 for the purpose of testing.
5. Construct a mapping file test-maps.xml. This will specify that user1 maps to testuser1 and user2 maps to testuser2. This will
also indicate the address mappings between the trace system and the test system.
6. Copy the merged.xml of interest in the directory ${testcase}/var/log/sipxpbx
7. Copy the validusers.xml file corresponding to merged.xml in the directory ${testcase}/etc/sipxpbx/validusers.xml
8. Run the tester on the system under regression test.  You would provide the testcase directory as input to the tester.

This will result in the call flow in testcase/var/log/sipxpbx/merged.xml
being emulated on the system under test. 

To run the canned example
=========================

Example1
========

This example emulates a call transfer between two polycom phones. The trace for this has been previously captured
and set up on trace system.

1. edit example1/test-maps.xml

2. Define testuser1 and testuser2 for the sytem under test.

Execute the test case using

ant test1




THIS TOOL IS IN AN EARLY STATE. IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE REPOSITORY FOR EARLY COMMENTS.
