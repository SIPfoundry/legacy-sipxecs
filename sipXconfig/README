PATH environment variable.

ACCESSING WEB GUI

With sipXconfig running, you can access the web interface by opening this URL
in your web browser:

SUPERADMIN

When you run sipXconfig for the first time, you will be prompted to choose
a PIN (password) for the "superadmin" user account.  Superadmin has the
