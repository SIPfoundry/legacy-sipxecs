help.views=Records views allow you to have a different set of DNS records for a regions \
 of your network.  You only need to specify any record views for regions that vary from \
 the default plan.  The default plan for a single region is to use only all services \
 equally.  If you have multiple regions, then services in a region are used equally first \
 and when there are no services left in a region, then all the services in other regions are \
 used equally.
help.failover=Fail-over plans control what services are used and when and how much traffic \
 they receive. Fail-over plans are used in DNS record views and be be reused for many views.
