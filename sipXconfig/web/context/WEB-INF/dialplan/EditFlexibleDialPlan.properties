quick.help=<p>Dial plans consist of various types of dial rules. You can configure dial plans by \
  adding, removing, editing, or reordering rules. It is possible to have more than one rule of each kind.</p>\
  <p>Rule order matters\: Make sure that more specific rules precede more general rules. For example, \
  move Long Distance rules for specified area codes above the default Long Distance rule.</p>

schedules.quick.help=<p>Schedules defined here can be used for time-based dialing rules.<br/>\
  By default all enabled dialing rules are active all the time. You can define a dialing rule \
  active at different times of the week by assigning a schedule defined here to a dialing rule.</p> \
