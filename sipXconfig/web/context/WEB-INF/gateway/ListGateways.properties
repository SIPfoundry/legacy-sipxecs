help.gatewayConfig=Configure "unmanaged gateways", "SIP trunks" and PSTN gateways. PSTN gateway models listed here are \
  plug & play configurable very similar to how phones are configured. A configuration file for the respective gateway is \
  automatically generated. It can be automatically downloaded by the gateway when the gateway is plugged in and powered \
  up, or the configuration file can be manually downloaded and transferred to the gateway. An "unmanaged gateway" needs to \
  be created for all manually configured gateways so that they can be inserted into the dialplan.
