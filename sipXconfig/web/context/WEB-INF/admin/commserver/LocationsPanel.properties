quick.help=Select one server in order to configure it and check out running services. \
Here you can add a new server in the cluster (for HA configuration) \
Each of the services can be configured from its respective entry in System menu. \
<p>Clicking the <em>Send Profiles</em> button will cause configuration files for \
all services to be sent (replicated) to the selected servers, and all affected services to be restarted automatically. \
This is rarely needed as configuration files are sent by default when their \
associated configuration has been changed.  However, in the case where a distributed server \
was not available at the time of a configuration change, this button can be used to re-send \
the configuration.</p>\
<p>Note that <em>sending profiles</em> to the master server will cause the in-memory database (MongoDB) to recreate \
and replicate to all slaves.</p> \
