quick.help=<p>Clicking the <em>Send Profiles</em> button will cause configuration files for \
all services to be sent to the selected servers, and all affected services to be restarted automatically. \
This is rarely needed as configuration files are sent by default when their \
associated configuration has been changed.  However, in the case where a distributed server \
was not available at the time of a configuration change, this button can be used to re-send \
the configuration.</p>\
