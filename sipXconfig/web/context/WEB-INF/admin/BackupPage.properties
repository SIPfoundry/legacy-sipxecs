description=Two backup plans can be defined: Local backup  and FTP backup. \
    You activate/deactivate the FTP backup plan by clicking the <em>FTP</em> checkbox.<\br>\
    When the <em>FTP</em> checkbox is checked, backup files are uploaded on the configured FTP server in the path \
    exposed by the supplied username/password.</br>\
    Each backup plan has its own setting for:<em>Number of backups to keep, Email address</em> or <em>Schedule</em><br/><br/>\
    To backup the system \
	select the desired backup options and press the <em>Backup Now</em> button. You \
    can perform a partial backup by leaving some options \
    unselected.<br/> Backup files will be available for download once the \
    backup is completed, no matter what backup plan is active. </br></br>\
    Backups can be sent by email, which allows scheduled backups to automatically be sent to your inbox.\
    This only includes configuration as the voicemail store easily exceeds the email size limit.<br/>

helpText=Click on each link to download the files.<br/>Backup files should be stored on media or a machine other than this server.

msg.schedule=Backups are stored in <em>/var/sipxdata/backup</em> in a subdirectory whose name corresponds to the date and \
	time the backup was made. <br><strong>Please note:</strong> when FTP backup plan is active, previous temporary saved backup files will be deleted \
	from local and the current ones will be saved in: <em>/var/sipxdata/ftpBackup</em>. \
	We recommend that you use NFS or a similar mechanism to automatically store full backups \
        on a different machine. Consult the admin guide for further information.
