	select the desired backup options and press the <em>Backup Now</em> button. You \
    can perform a partial backup by leaving some options \
    unselected.<br/> Backup files will be available for download once the \
    backup is completed.<br/><br/> \
    Backups can be sent by email, which allows scheduled backups to automatically be sent to your inbox.\
    This only includes configuration as the voicemail store easily exceeds the email size limit.<br/>
backupCompleted=Backup completed successfully. Please download archived data by clicking on the links below.
helpText=Click on each link to download the files.<br/>Backup files should be stored on media or a machine other than this server.

msg.schedule=Backups are stored in <em>/var/sipxdata/backups</em> in a subdirectory whose name corresponds to the date and \
	time the backup was made. We recommend that you use NFS or a similar mechanism to automatically store full backups \
        on a different machine. Consult the admin guide for further information.
