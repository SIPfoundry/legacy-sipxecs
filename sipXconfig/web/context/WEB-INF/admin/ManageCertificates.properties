quick.help.generate=Upon installation of your system a default <em>self-signed</em> certificate was installed \
	to secure Web access. This certificate causes browsers to show a security warning message. If you would like \
	to remove this warning you have to install a trusted certificate available from Certificate Authority \
	such as VeriSign, Entrust, Comodo, GlobalSign etc.<br/>\
	This page allows you to create the necessary Certificate Signing Request (CSR) needed by Certificate Authority \
	and then install the new certificate.<br/>\
	Generate a new Certificate Signing Request (CSR) by filling the \
    fields with the appropriate values and pressing the Generate button. \
