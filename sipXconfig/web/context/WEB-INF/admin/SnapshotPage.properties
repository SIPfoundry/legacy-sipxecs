quick.help=Snapshots are used for system diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes by a trained technician. \
	Snapshots contain all the relevant information to diagnose a problem you might experience with the system. \

	snapshot.<br/>\
	Since log files can be fairly large, it is possible to specify a date and time range of interest.
