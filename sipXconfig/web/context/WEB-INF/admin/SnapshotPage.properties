quick.help=Snapshots are used for system diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes by a trained technician. \
	Snapshots contain all the relevant information to diagnose a problem you might experience with the system. \
	Dependent on the configured log level of the system, more or less data is collected and made available in a \
	snapshot.<br/>\
	Since log files can be fairly large, it is possible to specify a date and time range of interest.
