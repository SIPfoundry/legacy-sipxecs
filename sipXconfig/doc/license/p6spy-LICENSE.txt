The original concept and code base for P6Spy was conceived and developed by Andy Martin, Ph.D. who generously contributed the first complete release to the public under this license.
This product was due to the pioneering work of Andy that began in December of 1995 developing applications that could seamlessly be deployed with minimal effort but with dramatic results. This code is maintained and extended by Jeff Goke and with the ideas and contributions of other P6Spy contributors. (http://www.p6spy.com)
