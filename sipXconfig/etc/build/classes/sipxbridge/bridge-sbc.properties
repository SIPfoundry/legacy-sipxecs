## settings
bridge-configuration.label=SIP
#bridge-configuration.description=

bridge-configuration.global-port.label=Public port
bridge-configuration.global-port.description=Set this if your ITSP requires a specific port.

#bridge-configuration.external-address.label=
bridge-configuration.external-address.description=The ITSP facing address. The ITSP will send signaling here.

bridge-configuration.external-port.label=External port
bridge-configuration.external-port.description=The ITSP facing port. The ITSP will send signaling here.

#bridge-configuration.local-address.label=
bridge-configuration.local-address.description=The SIPX proxy facing address. The SIPX proxy will send signaling here.

#bridge-configuration.local-port.label=
bridge-configuration.local-port.description=The SIPX proxy facing port. The SIPX proxy will send signaling here.

#bridge-configuration.sipx-proxy-domain.label=
bridge-configuration.sipx-proxy-domain.description=The SIPX proxy domain ( this should be configurable as a global - not a user settable parameter) . For the \
 prototype configure manually.

#bridge-configuration.stun-server-address.label=
bridge-configuration.stun-server-address.description=The stun server address used to determine the global address of the bridge.

bridge-configuration.sip-keepalive-seconds.label=Signaling keep-alive interval
bridge-configuration.sip-keepalive-seconds.description=Keepalive timer for SIP Signaling. sipXbridge will re-register with each ITSP to keep the NAT pinhole open

bridge-configuration.media-keepalive-seconds.label=Media keep-alive interval
bridge-configuration.media-keepalive-seconds.description=Keepalive timer for RTP. Each RTP stream facing the ITSP will start a timer that runs with this timeout (in \
 miliseconds).

#bridge-configuration.xml-rpc-port.label=
bridge-configuration.xml-rpc-port.description=Port for external XML RPC requests to be directed. If not specified, the XML RPC server is not started.

#bridge-configuration.max-number-of-concurrent-calls.label=
bridge-configuration.max-number-of-concurrent-calls.description=The maximum number of concurrent calls allowed via the given bridge overall. When the \
 limit is reached, sipxbridge will return "Service Unavailable". If unspecified, no limit is enforced.

bridge-configuration.music-on-hold-support-enabled.label=Music on hold
bridge-configuration.music-on-hold-support-enabled.description=If checked sipXbridge Music On Hold support is enabled.
bridge-configuration.music-on-hold-supported-codecs.description=Specifies the codecs that are permitted for call setup. Leave blank if you want all codecs permitted.

#bridge-configuration.rtp-port-range-start.label=
bridge-configuration.rtp-port-range-start.description=Start of the RTP ports range. The port range from start to end is assumed to free.

#bridge-configuration.rtp-port-range-end.label=
bridge-configuration.rtp-port-range-end.description=End of the RTP ports range.

bridge-configuration.route-inbound-calls-to-extension.label=Incoming calls destination
bridge-configuration.route-inbound-calls-to-extension.description=Determines where to send inbound calls. \
  If empty, inbound calls are directly routed to the specified number in the inbound request and have to be \
  redirected by aliases or dial plan rules. This setting applies to all ITSPs since it is not reliably possible \
  to detect from which ITSP  a call arrives if several ITSPs are configured. For incoming calls the ITSP domain \
  is mapped to the own domain (i.e. if a call arrives with sip:1234@myitsp.com, then \
  sipXbridge will map it to sip:1234@mydomain.com. An alias or user ID 1234 needs to exist or an alternative value can be specified in this field.)

bridge-configuration.log-level.label=Logging level
bridge-configuration.log-level.description=Log configuration. Defaults to INFO level.
#bridge-configuration.log-level.label.INFO=
#bridge-configuration.log-level.label.WARN=
#bridge-configuration.log-level.label.ERROR=
#bridge-configuration.log-level.label.DEBUG=

#bridge-configuration.log-directory.label=
bridge-configuration.log-directory.description=Log directory. Defaults to /var/log/sipxbpx/. The log file name is hard coded to "sipxbridge.log".
