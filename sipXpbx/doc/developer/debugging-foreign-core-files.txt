Examining a core file on a different machine than the one it was
created on.

Normally, it's impossible to examine a core file on a different
machine than the one it was created on because GDB recreates the
process' image using the dynamic libraries on the system GDB is
running on, which are usually different than those on the machine the
core file was created on.

But if you are careful, you can circumvent this feature of GDB and use
it to examine a core file from a different machine.

You will need:

- the core file

- the executable file 

- all of the dynamic libraries the process had loaded

You can get the list of dynamic libraries in two ways:

- run GDB on the original to look at the core file, and extract the
list of dynamic libraries that GDB says it is loading

- use "/lib/ld-linux.so.w --list <executable-file>"

To prepare:

- construct a file tree containing the dynamic libraries in their
relative positions, using a scratch directory as the "virtual root"

To run GDB:

- start GDB without arguments

- execute "set solib-absolute-prefix <absolute path of virtual root
for dyanmic libraries>".  Be careful that there are no trailing spaces
after the absolute path, as they will be incorporated into the path!
(Emacs' file-name completion will leave trailing spaces.)

- execute "file <executable-file>"  Note this file name is not
affected by the prefix.

- execute "core <core-file>" Note this file name is not affected by
the prefix.
