Usage:

    sipx-snapshot [ --include-secrets | -c  | --credentials ]
                  [ -nw | --no-www ]
                  [ --profiles ]
                  [ --cdr ]
                  [ -l  | --logs {current|all|nnn|none} ]
                  [ --log-start <date-time> [ --log-stop <date-time> ]]
                  [ --core <core-file> ] ...
                  [ --file <file-name> ] ...
                  [ --comment <file-name> ] ...
                                       [ <tar-file-name> ]

    sipx-snapshot [ -i  | --info-only ]

    sipx-snapshot -n  | --notar
                  { options as in the first form }
                                       [ <to-directory-name> ]

    Collects important sipXpbx configuration information
    and saves it in a file.  This is used to record configuration
    information to accompany a problem report.

    In the default mode (the first form shown), the output file is a
    gzipped tar file named <tar-file-name>.  The default name is
    '${DefaultTarFile}'.  The tar file contains a text file named
    SystemConfig that describes various system configuration information,
    and the sipXpbx configuration files.

    The second form, with the --info-only switch, only the system
    configuration information is collected; none of the sipXpbx configuration
    files are included, and the output is to standard output.

    The third form, with the --notar switch, prevents the saved files from
    being tar'ed -- they remain in a file tree that mirrors the originals;
    in this case the final argument is the name of the directory where the
    information should be saved.

    By default, all passwords and other secrets are removed from the recorded
    configuration files.  If diagnosing a particular problem requires that the
    real secret information be included, the --include-secrets switch
    causes it to be left in.

    The --no-www switch disables saving the apache configuration files.

    The --logs switch selects which logs are saved:
               current - saves all the current logs (not those saved by logrotate)
               all     - saves all logs in the sipx log directory (large!)
               nnn     - saves all logs from the specified set of past logs
               none    - does not include any logs (not recommended)

    The --log-start and --log-stop switches allow you to limit the log file
    size that is included in the snapshot to the times between the start and
    stop times.  Times MUST be specified in UCT (aka GMT) as used in the log
    files.  Only times in the 'current' log may be specified (not in archived
    logs).  If the --log-stop switch is not specified, the extract is from the
    start time to the end of the log file.

      --log-start '2004-12-08 17:45:30' --log-stop '2004-12-08 18:12:52'

    The --no-logs switch causes the sipX and Apache logs to be omitted
    from the snapshot; the default is to include them.  (deprecated but
    left in for backward compatibility - use '--logs none').

    The --profiles switch includes generated Phone and Gateway profile files,
    based on those that match a predefined filter.  Any passwords or other
    confidential information in these files will be included in the snapshot.

    The --cdr switch includes the data from call detail records; this is
    useful for debugging problems with the CDR system itself.

    The --core switch is used to specify the name of a core file to
    include among the files archived.  If the file name does not contain
    a /, it is searched for in @SIPX_LOGDIR@, otherwise it is searched for
    as usual.  The program 'file' is used to determine the corresponding
    executable file, the dynamic loader is used to determine the
    required dynamic libraries, and the executable and libraries are
    included among the files to be archived.  --core may be used
    multiple times.

    The --file switch is used to specify the name of a file to include
    among the files archived.  --file may be used multiple times.
    The argument to --file can be a wildcard, if it is quoted.

    The --comment switch is used to specify the name of a file to include
    among the files archived, but it will be at the top level of the saved
    file structure, rather than placed according to its full file name.
    --comment may be used multiple times.
    The argument to --comment can be a wildcard, if it is quoted.

    The --delete-logs option has been removed.

    During execution, sipx-snapshot constructs a temporary directory containing
    all the information to be saved, and sometimes additional temporary files.
    Especially if logs are included, this can occupy a lot of disk space.
    All temporary output is into the directory specified by \$TMPDIR (defaulting
    to /tmp), per the standard conventions.  If the execution of sipx-snapshot
    fails or is interrupted, it removes the temporary directory and files.

    If the --notar option is given, failure of sipx-snapshot does not
    cause the temporary files to be deleted.  Thus, when diagnosing a
    problem with sipx-snapshot's processing, use --notar.

    During execution, error output (stderr) while assembling the data
    is put in the file ./stderr in the temporary directory.  This file
    is saved in the resulting tar file, and at the end of execution,
    output to the pre-existing stderr.
