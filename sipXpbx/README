See INSTALL for installation instructions

Under Redhat, you can start the pbx and all it's necessary components by
running this command as root:

  service sipxecs start

Non Redhat users

  /usr/local/sipx/etc/init.d/sipxecs start

To investigate a process that may not be starting correctly:

  tail -f ${prefix}/var/log/sipxpbx/watchdog.log

and look in that directory for the log file for that process.

To inspect what processes are running:

  service sipxecs status
    or
  /usr/local/sipx/etc/init.d/sipxecs status
