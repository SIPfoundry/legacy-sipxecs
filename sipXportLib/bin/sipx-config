# Purpose of this script is to return locations of programs and
# settings used by the sipx family of modules.  This is installed for
# runtime scripts' usage.
# Configuration information about the sipX modules themselves is
# printed by the sipx*-config scripts.

# DEVELOPER NOTE: This is not meant to replace autoconf
# macros. Instead this is to find programs (like java) that can differ
# from what is used to compile then what is used to run.  This
# difference is extremely important when building binary distributions
# like RPMs
