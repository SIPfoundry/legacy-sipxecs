# Main entry point for cfengine agent run (scripts that actually do work)
#

#
# gather lists of CFEngine agent scripts and default entry point for each which
# is just the name of the agent script file sans extension.
# Example:
#   plugin.d/foo.cf
#
# will automatically be loaded on agent runs and the bundle will automatically be
# executed.
#
#  bundle foo {
#   reports:
#     "Hello World";
#  }
#
bundle common g {
  vars:
    any::
      # defined simply because subsequent cfengine calls require an upper limit
      "max_plugin_count" string => "100";

      # all files in plugin.d dir with extension *.cf will be loaded
      "plugins" slist => splitstring(execresult("/bin/find @SIPX_CFINPUTS@/plugin.d -name '*.cf'", "noshell"),"\n", "$(max_plugin_count)");

      # only files in base plugin.d dir with automatically use bundle.  plugin.d/foo.cf will load bundle "foo", but
      # plugin.d/mylib/bar.cf will not load bundle "bar"
      "bundles" slist => splitstring(execresult("/bin/find @SIPX_CFINPUTS@/plugin.d -maxdepth 1 -name '*.cf' -printf '%f\n' | /bin/sed 's/.cf//g' | sort", "useshell"),"\n", "$(max_plugin_count)");
}

#
# As soon as a bundle defines this, script is stopped
#  Example:
#    classes => if_notkept("fatal_error"),
#
body agent control {
  abortclasses => {
    "fatal_error"
  };
}


#
# Load and run cfengine agent scripts.
